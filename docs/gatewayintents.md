### [Discord Gateway Intents](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html)

If you want the bot to receive a **new type of event**, you might need to add the required intent in `client.ts` to receive that event. Have a look at [discord.js docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Intents?scrollTo=s-FLAGS) for the list of intents.
